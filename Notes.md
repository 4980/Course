## 1D

Scalar

Floats.

## 2D

Position v Vector

### Position 

A position or location is literaly a  location in space.

A vector is merely a direction. That's it.

## Triangles

Three sides to a triangles

Interior and exterior angle.

Interior angle + exterior angle = 360e

## Two kinds of angles.

Degrees v Radians

360 degrees in a circle.

2 * Pi radians in a circle

If I have x degrees, how mant radians do I have????


Sum of all interior angles in a triangle = 180.

## Three kinds of angles:

Acute: Less than a right angles

Right: 90 degrees or PI halves radians

Obtuse: Greater than right angles

## Trig

## Trig Example

Fire a rocket at 45 degrees. How far does it travel in x and y in 1 second a 1 unit/second velocity.

Parts of a triangle:

Hypotenus - longest leg or leg opposite right angle

Adjacent Leg

Opposite Leg


Sine - Sin(Angle) = Opposite Leg/ Hypotenus

Cosine - Cos(Angle) Adjacent Leg/Hypotenus

Tangent - Tan(Angle) Opposite Leg / Adjacent Leg


Sin(Angle) - Y
Cos(Angle) - X
Atan(Y/X) - Angle in Q1,2
Atan2(Y,X) - Angle in Q1,2,3,4

## Dots and Crosses

Dot Product

The dot produt gives the cosine of the angle between two vectors


V1 = (V1_x,V1_y), V2=(V2_x,V2_y)
Dot product = (V1_x*V2_x) + (V1_y*V2_y). ALways a scalar.
Dot product coolness

If the the vectors are normalized...
Dot product of 1 = colinear.
0 = orthogonal/perpendicular
-1 = Antiparallel

##  Normalizing

Always normalize first (almost).
Normalize means set length to 1.
To normalize divide the vector by its length.

##Vector length??

Euclidean distance or L2 Norm.

Euclidean distance Sqaure Root of the sum of the sqaures.

sqaure root of(x*x + y*y).

## 3D

Right handedness and left handedness

##Cross Product

Given two vectors, the cross product gives a thrid vector that is orthogonal to both vectors.
